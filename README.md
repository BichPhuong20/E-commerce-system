# E-commerce-system

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to investigate the sales and delivery processes of online platforms such as Tiki or Shopee. The focus is on understanding the entire business workflow, redesigning the data structure (from conceptual to physical), implementing the physical data design into the MS SQL database management system with a substantial amount of data and related constraints, conducting extensive testing with assumed high-frequency queries, and proposing solutions to enhance query performance. Additionally, the project includes programming a simulation of the surveyed system, covering functions such as product browsing, searching, purchasing, order tracking, inventory management, and sales statistics.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis and Design
- **Business Process Description:**
  - Thoroughly describe the end-to-end business process of sales, order reception, delivery, and payment.

- **Data Design (Conceptual to Physical):**
  - Design the data structure, progressing from conceptual to physical models.

- **Implementation of Physical Data Design:**
  - Set up the physical database design in the MS SQL database management system, incorporating a substantial dataset and relevant constraints.

- **Query Testing and Optimization:**
  - Conduct tests with various queries assuming high-frequency usage. Observe test results and propose solutions to improve query efficiency, particularly for search, selection, and ordering queries.

### Phase 2: System Simulation
- **Functionalities:**
  - Develop a simulation of the surveyed system, including features such as product viewing, searching, purchasing, order tracking, inventory management, and sales statistics.

- **Stage 1: Process Description, Data, and Constraints:**
  - Describe the process, data, related constraints, and a list of functionalities to be built, along with corresponding transaction frequencies. Encourage students to observe, analyze, and propose improvements.

- **Stage 2: Database Design and Implementation:**
  - Propose a database design from conceptual to physical based on the group's recommendations. Include suggestions for query performance improvement. Provide the source code for simulating functionalities and scripts for creating the database, queries, indexes, partitions, etc.

The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of online sales processes, thorough database design, and effective system simulation.
